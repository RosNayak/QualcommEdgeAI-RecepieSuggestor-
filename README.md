FridgeChef: Voice- and Camera-Controlled Real-time Recipe Suggestion

## Project Overview
The Recipe Suggestor project is an intelligent Android application that leverages on-device machine learning to identify fruits and vegetables in real time and generate recipe suggestions tailored to the detected ingredients.

##Motivation
Consumers often have ingredients at home but struggle to decide what meals they can prepare. Traditional recipe apps require manual input of items, which is time-consuming and error-prone. By automatically recognizing ingredients from a phone camera, Recipe Suggestor reduces friction, empowers healthier eating habits, and showcases the potential of on-device AI.

## Key Features

•⁠  ⁠Ingredient Recognition: Real-time detection of fruits and vegetables using on-device Gemini nano from Google ML Kit.
•⁠  ⁠Continuous Inference Pipeline: Captures live camera frames, processes them through the ML model, and updates detected items dynamically without saving images.
•⁠  ⁠Recipe Recommendation: Maps detected ingredients to curated recipes using Gemini 2.5 flash-lite.
•⁠  ⁠Modern UI: CameraX and Bottom Sheet based UI for better user experience.
•⁠  ⁠Adaptable and reliable: Capable of handling most ingredient categories without issue.
